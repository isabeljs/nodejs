## Editorial

> Hey :)
>
> You may wonder: *why on earth would I need yet another framework to build my RESTful services?!* Well, that's a very good question, I'm glad you asked!
>
> As you may already know, in his blog post *[REST APIs must be hypertext-driven](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven)*, Roy Fielding [editor's note: the coiner of REST] clarified that **just invoking a service via HTTP does not make it RESTful**. Indeed, in order for an API to be *effectively RESTful*, [it must adhere to a given set of constraints](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/rest/1664/getting-started-with-rest/20145/rest-over-http#t=201612041701262938012) (like being stateless, resource-focused, hypertext-driven, etc.).
>
> And that's where I come in: I'm trying to go behind the buzzword REST became, and to (modestly and noninvasively) help you building *real RESTful services* with Node.js by providing tools and utilities built upon exciting technologies such as [ECMAScript 6](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ECMAScript#/6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015) and [koa](http://koajs.com/).

> I hope you appreciate my advices (please don't hesitate to correct me when I'm wrong), and have a happy coding!
